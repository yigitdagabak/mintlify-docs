# Demiurg Features

Demiurg is designed to make AI agent creation accessible and powerful. Go from a simple idea to a deployed, interactive agent faster than ever before. Here's a closer look at the core features that enable this workflow:

## Build with Plain English

Forget boilerplate code and complex setups. With Demiurg, you initiate agent creation using natural language prompts.

* **How it Works:** Describe the agent's purpose, key skills, data sources, or persona in the prompt area. Demiurg interprets your requirements to configure and build the agent.
* **Why it Matters:** Lowers the barrier to entry for creating AI agents. Enables rapid prototyping and iteration, even for experienced developers. Focus on *what* the agent should do, not *how* to scaffold it.

// Example Prompt Snippet:
"I need a customer support agent for my e-commerce store. It should answer FAQs based on our knowledge base, handle order tracking lookups via API, and escalate complex issues to a human agent."
