# Chat with Your Agent

</Frame>

Once you've created your agent, it's time to start interacting with it. Effective communication will help you get the most out of your AI assistant.

## Getting Started

When you first open a chat with your agent, you'll see a welcome message that outlines what the agent can do for you. This is a good time to:

1. Confirm the agent understands its purpose
2. Test basic capabilities with simple requests
3. Explore the agent's knowledge boundaries

<Tip>
  Start with simple requests before moving to more complex tasks. This helps you understand your agent's strengths and limitations.
</Tip>

## The Chat Interface

</Frame>

The Demiurg chat interface includes several helpful features:

- **Message input**: Type your messages here
- **File attachments**: Upload documents for your agent to analyze
- **Conversation memory**: Your agent remembers the entire conversation context
- **Chat controls**: Options for clearing history, sharing conversations, etc.

## Effective Prompting Techniques

How you phrase your requests greatly impacts your agent's responses. Here are some techniques for better results:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Clear and Specific" icon="bullseye" defaultOpen>
    Instead of "Give me some ideas," try "Give me 5 blog post ideas about sustainable gardening for beginners."
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    "Can you create a 7-day meal plan for a vegetarian athlete who trains 5 days a week? Include breakfast, lunch, dinner, and two snacks per day, with approximate calorie counts."
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Provide Context" icon="info-circle">
    Give relevant background information to help your agent understand your needs better.
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    "I'm preparing for a job interview at a marketing agency. The role is for a content strategist position. Can you help me prepare answers for likely questions about content analytics and SEO strategy?"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Break Down Complex Tasks" icon="layer-group">
    For complicated requests, break them into smaller, sequential steps.
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    "Let's analyze this sales data step by step:
    1. First, identify the top 3 performing products
    2. Then, suggest reasons for their success
    3. Finally, recommend strategies to boost sales of lower-performing items"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Follow-up Questions" icon="comments">
    If the initial response isn't quite what you needed, ask clarifying questions to refine the results.
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    "Could you make these instructions more concise and bullet-pointed for easier reference?"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using Advanced Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="File Analysis" icon="file-lines">
    Upload documents for your agent to analyze by clicking the attachment icon. Supported formats include PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, and more.
    
    **Example prompt after upload:**
    ```
    "Summarize the key points from this report and highlight any unusual trends."
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Memory Management" icon="brain">
    Your agent remembers your conversation history to maintain context. For long sessions, you can:
    
    - Start a new thread for separate topics
    - Use the "Clear History" option to reset context
    - Reference specific parts of your conversation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  While your agent has been created with specific knowledge domains, it may occasionally provide incorrect information. Always verify critical information from trustworthy sources.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If your agent isn't responding as expected, try these approaches:

1. **Rephrase your request** using more specific language
2. **Provide examples** of the type of response you're looking for
3. **Break complex requests** into smaller, simpler questions
4. **Check knowledge boundaries** by asking what the agent knows about the topic
5. **Restart the conversation** if the agent seems confused

<Info>
  If you notice your agent consistently struggling with certain tasks, you might need to refine its description or use the Code Editor for more advanced customization.
