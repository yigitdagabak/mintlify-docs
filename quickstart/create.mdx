Creating your first AI agent with Demiurg is remarkably simple. You'll be amazed at how quickly you can go from idea to working agent with just a natural language description.

<Tip>
  The more specific your description, the better your agent will perform. Think about what knowledge domains, personality traits, and capabilities you want your agent to have.
</Tip>

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Demiurg Playground">
    Visit [demiurg.ai/app](https://demiurg.ai/app) and log in to your account. If you don't have an account yet, you'll need to create one.
    
    Click on the "Create New Agent" button to begin.

  <Step title="Describe Your Agent">

    ```
    
    ```
    "Create a personal fitness coach that can design workout routines, track progress, and provide nutritional advice. It should be motivating but not pushy, and adapt recommendations based on user feedback."

## Tips for Effective Agent Creation

- **Be specific**: Instead of "a marketing assistant," try "a social media marketing specialist focused on Instagram and TikTok content creation."
- **Include domains**: Mention specific knowledge areas like "financial analysis," "creative writing," or "customer support."
- **Define personality**: Specify tone characteristics like "professional and concise" or "friendly and conversational."
- **List key tasks**: Explicitly state what you want the agent to help with, like "research competitors," "draft emails," or "analyze data."
