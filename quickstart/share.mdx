One of Demiurg's most powerful features is the ability to share your custom agents with others. Whether you're collaborating with teammates, helping friends, or publishing to the wider community, sharing extends the value of your creations.

## Sharing Options

Demiurg offers several ways to share your agents:

  </Card>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Permission Levels

When sharing an agent, you can set different permission levels:

| Permission | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **View Only** | Recipients can chat with the agent but cannot modify it |
| **Edit** | Recipients can modify the agent's settings and description |
| **Admin** | Recipients can edit and further share the agent with others |
| **Clone** | Recipients can create their own copy of your agent |

<Tip>
  For most casual sharing, "View Only" is sufficient. Reserve higher permissions for close collaborators or team members.
</Tip>

    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a Message (Optional)">
    Include a personal message explaining the agent's purpose and how it might be helpful to the recipients.

    "I created this research assistant to help with literature reviews. It's great at summarizing papers and finding connections between different studies!"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm and Share">
    Review your sharing settings and click "Share Agent" to complete the process. Recipients will receive a notification with access to your agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Shared Agents

After sharing your agent, you can manage access and permissions at any time:

1. Go to your agent's settings
2. Select the "Sharing" tab
3. View current shares and modify as needed:
   - Change permission levels
   - Remove access
   - Add new recipients
