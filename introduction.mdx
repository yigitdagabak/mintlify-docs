## What Makes Demiurg Different

Most AI tools require technical expertise or endless configuration. Demiurg eliminates these barriers by turning your ideas into fully functional agents through simple conversation.

</div>

### From Prompt to Powerful Agent

<Steps>
  ### Describe what you need
  ```
  I need an AI agent that can analyze financial markets and provide trading 
  insights. It should analyze correlations between crypto and traditional 
  markets, identify market regimes, predict trends, and suggest trading 
  strategies based on risk tolerance.
  ```

  ### Demiurg builds your agent
  Your description is transformed into a complete agent with all necessary files, tools, and capabilities.

  ### Start using immediately
  Your new agent (in this case, Sarah Chen, Financial Analyst) is instantly available for conversation.
