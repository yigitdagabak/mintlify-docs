You can customize three key aspects of your agent's appearance:

1. **Name**: Choose a name that reflects your agent's purpose or personality
2. **Description**: Create a brief summary of what your agent does
3. **Avatar**: Select or generate a visual representation of your agent

## How to Customize Appearance

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Agent Settings">
    From your agent's page, click on the "Settings" or "Edit" button to access customization options.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Change Agent Name">
    Enter a clear, descriptive name for your agent. Good names often reflect the agent's purpose, like "Marketing Assistant" or "Code Helper."
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update Description">
    Write a concise description (typically 1-2 sentences) explaining what your agent does. This helps users understand your agent's capabilities at a glance.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customize Avatar">
    You have several options for your agent's avatar:
    
    - **Upload an image**: Click "Upload" to use your own image
    - **Generate an avatar**: Click "Generate" for an AI-created avatar based on your agent's purpose
    - **Choose from gallery**: Select from pre-made avatar options
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click "Save" or "Apply" to update your agent's appearance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Using the "Generate" feature for avatars creates unique images that visually represent your agent's purpose and personality. This can help users intuitively understand what your agent does.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

- **Memorable names**: Choose names that are easy to remember and type
- **Clear descriptions**: Focus on what the agent does rather than technical details
- **Consistent visuals**: Select avatars that match your agent's purpose and tone
- **Visual distinction**: Make sure agents for different purposes look distinctly different

<Info>
  If you're creating multiple agents, establishing a consistent naming and visual convention can help users navigate between them more easily.
