Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective instructions for AI systems. In Demiurg, your prompt is the foundation of your agent's capabilities. Mastering these techniques will help you create more effective, specialized, and reliable agents.

<Info>
  The quality of your prompts directly impacts the performance of your agents. Small changes in wording can lead to significant differences in agent behavior.
