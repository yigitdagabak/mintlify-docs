## From Prompt to Powerful Agent in Minutes

Creating sophisticated AI agents is now as easy as describing them:

<Steps>
  ### 1. Describe
  Tell Demiurg what kind of agent you need in plain English â€“ outline its purpose, capabilities, and any specific requirements.

  ### 2. Generate & Test
  Demiurg instantly generates the necessary code structure and files, deploys the agent, and provides a chat interface for immediate testing.

  ### 3. Use & Customize
  Interact with your agent via web or mobile. Share it with others, use pre-built templates, or dive into the integrated code editor to fine-tune its behavior.
</Steps>

## See It In Action

Here's how a request translates into a ready-to-use agent:

<div className="nx-mt-6 nx-flex nx-flex-col nx-space-y-4">
  {/* User Prompt */}
  <div className="nx-rounded-lg nx-border nx-bg-gray-100 nx-p-4 dark:nx-border-neutral-800 dark:nx-bg-neutral-900">
    <p className="nx-font-semibold nx-text-gray-700 dark:nx-text-gray-300">You:</p>
    <p className="nx-mt-1">I need an AI agent that can analyze financial markets and provide trading insights. It should handle crypto/traditional market correlations, identify market regimes, predict trends using ML, and suggest strategies based on risk tolerance. Needs expertise in both asset classes.</p>
  </div>

  {/* Demiurg Response 1 (Conceptual) */}
  <div className="nx-rounded-lg nx-border nx-border-primary-500/20 nx-bg-primary-50/50 nx-p-4 dark:nx-border-primary-500/30 dark:nx-bg-primary-500/5">
    <p className="nx-font-semibold nx-text-primary-600 dark:nx-text-primary-400">Demiurg:</p>
    <p className="nx-mt-1">Understood. I'll create Sarah Chen, a Senior Quantitative Analyst specializing in crypto-traditional market correlations, ML-based predictions, and algorithmic trading strategies. I'll build her using OpenAI's Agent SDK for advanced capabilities like tool usage and structured outputs.</p>
  </div>

  {/* Demiurg Response 2 (Ready) */}
   <div className="nx-rounded-lg nx-border nx-border-primary-500/20 nx-bg-primary-50/50 nx-p-4 dark:nx-border-primary-500/30 dark:nx-bg-primary-500/5">
    <p className="nx-font-semibold nx-text-primary-600 dark:nx-text-primary-400">Demiurg:</p>
    <p className="nx-mt-1">I've created Sarah Chen, your financial analysis agent built with OpenAI's Agent SDK. She can analyze market correlations, detect regimes, and provide trading strategies. Would you like to test her capabilities? (Switching to test interface...)</p>
