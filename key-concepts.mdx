Demiurg revolves around a few core concepts that empower you to build and manage automated processes with ease. This page provides an overview of each concept and how they interrelate.

## Playbooks

**Playbooks** are the cornerstone of Demiurg. They contain the instructions (written in natural language) that define how your automated processes should run. Here’s what you need to know:

- **Natural Language Format**: Write your steps just like you would describe them to a person.
- **Reusable**: A single playbook can be reused across multiple agents or scenarios.
- **AI-Assisted Editing**: Leverage Demiurg AI to generate, modify, or improve playbook content in real-time.

## Agents

**Agents** are the automated workers that carry out your playbooks. Think of them as specialized executors that can:

- Interpret and run playbooks.
- Integrate with various data sources or services.
- Report status and metrics in real-time to your Agent Dashboard.

## Integrations

Demiurg supports a wide range of **integrations** to connect your agents and playbooks with external systems:

- **Communication Channels**: Chatbots, email, social media, and more.
- **Data Sources**: Databases, spreadsheets, APIs, or other platforms.
- **Custom Tools**: Extend Demiurg’s functionality with your own scripts or third-party libraries.

## AI Assistance

One of the most powerful aspects of Demiurg is its built-in **AI Assistance**:

- **Content Generation**: Automatically create new sections or entire playbooks from prompts.
- **Enhancements**: Get suggestions to refine, optimize, or troubleshoot your existing playbooks.
- **Real-time Guidance**: Receive best practices, syntax help, and examples as you type.

## Editor & Dashboard

- **Editor**: A TipTap-based interface where you write and refine your playbooks with live AI help.
- **Dashboard**: Monitor agent performance, manage configurations, and access high-level insights in a single pane.
